# RSLDA

This repository provides MATLAB implementation of **Ratio Sum Linear Discriminant Analysis (RSLDA)** using the **Minorization-Maximization (MM)** and **Double-Loop (DL)** algorithms.  

## Files
- **demo_rslda.m**  
  Example script comparing the convergence behavior of MM and DL algorithms.  

- **rslda.m**  
  Core function for RSLDA using both MM and DL optimization algorithms.  

- **rsldaini.m**  
  Initialization function for RSLDA parameters.  

## Usage
Run `demo_rslda.m` to reproduce the convergence comparison experiments.
